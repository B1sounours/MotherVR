I'll be updating this area soon, so that you don't need to read through all of the Release notes to get caught up.
## Installation
Drag the `dxgi.dll` into your Alien: Isolation game folder. That's it. Really, that's all you do.

If you'd like to disable the mod (so you can switch back to play it in regular 2D), add `-novr` in the Launch Options in Steam.
